#
# This is a localization file. The way it works is that there
# is a key, then a value (programming terms):
#
# key: "value"
# hello: "hi"
#
# If you are translating this, only worry about the value, the stuff in quotes.
# For example, if I were translating this into pirate speak, the hello line
# would be:
#
# hello: "ahoy"
#
# There are some phrases that have substitutions in them. These are bracketed:
#
# "A piece of art by %{name}."
#
# This example just means that a person's name will be used in there.
#
# Comments have # in front of them. These are purely informational to help
# guide the translation to other languages. They do not require translation.
